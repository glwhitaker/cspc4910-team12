CPSC 4910 Database
By Kevin Blinn

In the beginning of the semester, I was tasked to make our DB for CPSC 4910
because I was also talking CPSC 4160 Database Management. I created the database during Sprint 05.

As the semester progress, my database skills have increased significantly and I've realized that we had to change our database schema in order to complete this project.
